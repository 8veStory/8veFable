# GitHub Pages

Yes, it is possible to set things up so that anyone who clones your repository can easily start the website locally. You can use a Gemfile to specify the exact gems and versions your project needs, which can be installed using Bundler. Here's how you can do it:

Create a Gemfile in your project root: This file is where you specify the Ruby gems your project depends on. In your case, you would need at least the jekyll gem and the bundler gem.
Here's a simple Gemfile that should work for your case:

ruby
Copy code
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'jekyll', '~> 4.2.0'
gem 'bundler', '~> 2.2.0'
You can adjust the version numbers as needed.

Install Bundler: If you haven't already, install Bundler with gem install bundler.

Install the project dependencies: Run bundle install in the project root. This will install all the gems specified in your Gemfile, including Jekyll.

Add a README: In your README file, include instructions for how to clone and run your project. It might look something like this:

markdown
Copy code
