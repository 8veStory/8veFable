# Why Hello There
My aim with this blog is to:
- Share uni course notes
- Share my Blender progress, documenting my growth from novice to a (hopefully) good 3D modeller.
- Share my Engineering journey, documenting any learnings I come across as I grow from a junior to a (hopefully) good engineer.

ad astra,
