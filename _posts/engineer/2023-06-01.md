Created rough idea for a cross-OS desktop virtual assistant using ChatGPT.

- AI Desktop Assistant: similar to the Tasker one. It can:
	- Talk to it via Text to Speech voice input w/ Whisper API
	- Generates response using ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo API
	- Responds back using:
		- (default) free Speech Synthesis
		- (optional) Microsoft Neural Voices
		- (optional) Eleven Labs
	- Can view chat history and current chat logs
	- API has a 'Memory' of prior conversations (we send the last 10 conversations)
		- Extension: We send up to 4,096 tokens, removing the rest
		- Extension: We use [LlammaLLM](https://pythonwarriors.com/how-to-build-your-chatbot-using-custom-knowledge-base-with-llamaindex-openai-and-streamlit/) to have long-term memory of the entire conversation!
	- Can Adjust the 'Assistant Personality' (System Prompt)

Can have plugins, like Google Calendar and Gmail Integration.
